## Why I chose Composite Pattern to solve the problem
_The problem involved the creating of a hierarchical structure to define the organizational model of the company as we narrowed down how to solve the problem. Once we completed the entity diagrams and studied how it should be structured it was easy to decide to use composite as the main bedrock of the solution. 
Since the structure is made up of employees who are hired by another employee who manages the employees. It also needs for an employee with subordinates to know how much their chain of subordinates needs to get paid. So thereby making a hierarchical structure with references to subordinates needed to solve the problem_
